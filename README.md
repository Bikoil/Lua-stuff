# Welcome to my main lua repository!
- this is the workspace for me as a lua dev

- some of the this repository code can be found on other platforms like Gitlab and Gitkraken and Replit and thats where I run my code (I also use Termux and other Terminal Emulators)
- in this repo, you may find:
  - Random Stuff
  - Maybe some command line games
  - linux programs I made for fun
  - other projects
# Please Remember that most of these are WIP (Work In Progress) or don't exist yet
- if there are any issues/suggestions, please tell me in an issue! 

*For Early Access/Beta scripts, visit the TestBranch*
__*Remember that this Branch shall contain working complete lua projects, TestBranch has half working or non working at all scripts*__
